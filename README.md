# Voice Cloning AI

Voice cloning AI (deepfake for voice). Using cloned voice from only 5-10 seconds of targeted voice.

Implementation used an unofficial (but popular) Implementation of the famous paper "Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis
"

This demo is used only for educational perposes.

## Results:

### Reference voice 1:
